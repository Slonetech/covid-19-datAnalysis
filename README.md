# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project involves building a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time. The project includes cleaning and processing real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insights, and visualizing trends using Python data tools. The final output is a comprehensive data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

## Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries and regions
- Visualize trends using charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (or VS Code with Jupyter extension)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Optional: plotly, geopandas

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Download the COVID-19 dataset (e.g., `owid-covid-data.csv` from Our World in Data).
2. Place the dataset in your working directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
5. Review the narrative insights and visualizations embedded in the notebook.
6. Optionally, export the notebook to PDF or PowerPoint for sharing.

## Insights and Reflections
- The project highlights the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing for accurate analysis.
- Visualizations reveal varying COVID-19 trends and vaccination rollouts across countries.
- Exploratory data analysis uncovers key patterns such as the death rate and vaccination progress.
- Building a choropleth map provides an intuitive way to communicate global disparities.
- Documenting findings with narrative explanations enhances the interpretability and impact of the analysis.

#  COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

##  Project Description

This project is a data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries and time periods. Using Python data tools, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizes trends to extract meaningful insights.

By the end, the project delivers a well-documented report with code, visuals, and written interpretations — ideal for presentation or publishing.
